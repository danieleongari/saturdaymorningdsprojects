# Saturday Morning Data Science Projects

Collection of quick & dirty data science projects aimed to investigate topics that I find interesting.

Title inspired from [Andriew Ng's quote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=733m6qBH-jI) *"Passion is what you do on Saturday morning"*.

## Projects on [nbViewer](https://nbviewer.org/)
### 01 - Will I ever retire in Italy?
1. [Investigating Italian population](https://nbviewer.org/github/danieleongari/saturdaymorningdsprojects/blob/master/01_will_i_ever_retire_in_italy/1_investigating_italian_population.ipynb)
2. [What's the killer of 2003?](https://nbviewer.org/github/danieleongari/saturdaymorningdsprojects/blob/master/01_will_i_ever_retire_in_italy/2_whats_the_killer_of_2003.ipynb)
3. Future projections of retired/working population

## Rules:
1. State the `AIM` of the analysis at the beginning of the project
2. End the notebook with a `Conclusion` section, summarizing the findings, and a `Follow-up` section, listing possible next steps to take
3. Make intense use of [GitHuub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)
4. Explore creative uses of [plotly](https://plotly.com/python/) for interactive visualizations
5. Don't spend more than 2 hours on a project - this is a Saturday morning activity, not a full-blown project that will take weeks to complete
6. The previous point was totally sugested by Copilot... I'm not sure if I agree with it, but it's a fair reminder!
7. Don't be too strict in using statisticly sound methods (for sake of time), but be open to critics in case the analisis was too handwaving
8. Come back from time to time, to revise the narrative of the analysis to make it clearer and clearer
9. Be totally open to comments, suggestions, and collaborations: for any of them, open an Issue or a Pull Request!
10. Don't have more than 10 rules
