    "- I made some assumptions on the age at which people starts to work and retired in the past\n",
    "- I computed a ratio between working-age and retired-age people of 2.0 - 2.4 in the historical data, and picked an average value of 2.2 as the \"referance\" one to keep constant in the future\n",
    "- Based on my projection of Italian future population, being born in 1990, I expect to retire at 68-74 year old (2058-2064) depending on the scenario (9 scenarios from Notebook#3)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Follow-up\n",
    "- Consider unemployment: this is a self-balancing secondary effect as less woking people might compensate lower unemployment too\n",
    "- Run a sensitivity test on the \"reference\" ratio of working-age/retirement-age people as it is a very handwavy estimate\n",
    "- Get more data on effective historical start age and retirement age\n",
    "- Run a sensitivity test on the age at which people will start to work\n",
